<!-- ************************************************************************
* This page is designed like old-school HTML intended to allow for easy
* downloading and offline use.
* You will need to download: index.html, CypherBunk2076.js, & CypherBunkUI.js
*   - you need the 4 icon_*.svg images for the top right navigation
*   - you will also need to link to jQuery.
*   - keys.js is optional for pre-computed keys
*   - asciiLogos.js is also optional (it just pre-populates the <textarea>)
* If you want to use the library with your own UI, you only need:
*   - CypherBunk2076.js
*   - and jQuery (any version with $.ajax(), but I tested with v3.6.0)
* 
* This is effectively a simple cypher encoder/decoder, but instead of a 1:1
* mapping of text to cypher-text, the encoding is randomized across all
* instances of each character across the cypher. So encrypting the same message
* twice will NOT yield the same cyphertext, but both will decrypt correctly.
*
* This is *NOT* a strong encryption meant to replace AES/DES/RSA/etc...
* It *IS* meant to allow for ad-hoc encryption/decryption.
*
* Click the Help icon for more details and a use case.

    <h3>Static Javascript Keys</h3>
    <p>If you're proficient at Javascript, you can download/modify this document to keep pre-computed Cypher Keys. These will perform more quickly, and you can distribute your keys.js to your friends to use the same key.</p>
    <p>If there is no JS code below, close this popup and encrypt something in the main window. Then open this popup again.</p>
    <p>(Note: if you are already using Predefined Keys, we won't re-generate them here)</p>
    <p>Copy the JS code below, put it in a keys.js file, and link to it above this document's &lt;script&gt; tag.</p>

  <div id="helpCard" class="card invisible">
    <h3>What is CypherBunk?</h3>
    <p>It offers easy Ad-Hoc encryption for friends.</p>
    <p>You don't have to have PGP keys or some other setup in advance. You can just encrypt the message and tell them what the key is later.</p>

    <h3>How Secure is CypherBunk?</h3>
    <p>If you are looking for strong encryption, you are better off exploring AES/DES/RSA/etc...</p>
    <p>While CypherBunk is weaker, it is much more than a simple 1-to-1 cypher. As long as you use a fairly long key, the encryption is "good enough" for most people. It would take a *LOT* of compute power to be able to crack CypherBunk.</p>
    <p>The easiest way to "crack" CypherBunk is to guess the key. So don't treat the Key like a password. The best cypher keys are ones you could copy and paste from reliably consistent sources.</p>

    <h3>What Key Should I Use?</h3>
    <p>Web Pages that don't change often are great keys, which is why we offer a Key URL option. CypherBunk will fetch that Web Page and use its HTML as your key.</p>
    <p>Linking to eBooks, Dictionaries, Discographies, Glossaries, or other fairly static lists can be a great key.</p>
    <p>Don't link to Dynamic Web Pages. Even a page that displays the current date would break, because if the key changes by even 1 character, the message can no longer be decrypted with that URL.</p>
    <p>If you and your friends regularly use a specific Key URL, you may consider using a URL shortening service like bit.ly, because then you just have to remember the short URL, yet you can have a massive key.</p>

    <h3>Troubleshooting:</h3>
    <p>Can't Fetch Key URL: Some Websites don't allow remote fetching of their content, so you will have to use another site. Libraries like JS or CSS are often good ways around this, because those sites generally WANT you to link to them.</p>
    <p>Decrypts to Weird Characters: Ensure you've pasted the encrypted message properly (CypherBunk will attempt to remove erroneous characters). More often than not, the Key isn't matching.  If you are using a Key URL, the site may have changed its content. If you are using Full Key Text, you may have copied/pasted differently than the person who encrypted the message. Even 1 character different will break the decryption, so ensure you and your friends have agreed upon the key (including leading/trailing spaces or newlines).</p>

    <h3>Use Case:</h3>
    <p>Alice wants to send an encrypted message to Bob, but they don't have access to their personal computers, but have access to something with a simple web-browser.</p>
    <p>Alice accesses this page, types her message, encrypts it with a key that either she and Bob both know, or she could communicate verbally (like a shortened bit.ly link to Lorem Ipsum), and sends the encrypted message to Bob.</p>
    <p>Bob sees the message that just looks like numbers, understands this is a cypher text, and waits to be told what key to use to decrypt it.</p>
    <p>Alice tells Bob to go to a bit.ly link for the key.</p>
    <p>Bob goes to this page, provides the bit.ly link as the decryption key, pastes the encrypted message, and is able to decrypt it successfully.</p>
