# cypherbunk
Ad-hoc encryption for friends

This Single HTML file has no external dependencies other than Vanilla JS.

I embedded all SVGs in it, so there is no <img> linking.

As such, it can be downloaded and run offline easily (provided you aren't using a URL as your Cypher Key).

Also, you can pre-compute and link your key as cb_key.js

NOTE: I left DEBUG_LEVEL at 1 for some console.log message
